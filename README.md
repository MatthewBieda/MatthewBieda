ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt

I developed GraphVis, an interactive web tool for clarifying Graph Algorithms.
I also made jp-translate.cloud, a cutting-edge open source Japanese â‡‹ English machine translation system for my postgraduate project.  

And I have built many smaller projects, check out my website (https://matthewbieda.github.io) for more information!
