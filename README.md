ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt

Currently working on VKEngine. 

I also developed GraphVis, an interactive web tool for clarifying Graph Algorithms and jp-translate.cloud, a cutting-edge open source Japanese â‡‹ English machine translation system.  
I have built many smaller projects as well, check out my website (https://matthewbieda.github.io) for more information!
