ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt

I developed jp-translate.cloud, a cutting-edge open source Japanese â‡‹ English machine translation system.   
I have built several web applications using Django and the PERN stack, check out my website (https://matthewbieda.github.io) and blog (https://matthewbieda.eu.pythonanywhere.com/blog) for more information!
